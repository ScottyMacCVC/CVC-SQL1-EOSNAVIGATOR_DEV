# Presentation

## Content 
### Team members have drafted their project, including the following: 
1. **Selected topic** - Predict a successful outcome for a Labor Productivity input in each of 3 geographic operating divisions (Sacramento, Reno, Fresno)
2. **Reason why we selected our topic** -  To determine the most signifcant factors for predicting labor productivity and utilize model feedback to support efficacy of human generated inputs.
3. **Description of our source of data** - data exported from source IBM database from 2016 to 2021 for completed projects. (https://github.com/ScottyMacCVC/CVC-SQL1-EOSNAVIGATOR_DEV/blob/main/txt.zip or https://github.com/ScottyMacCVC/CVC-SQL1-EOSNAVIGATOR_DEV/blob/main/csv.zip)

**Variables include:**
-   Job City
-   Distance Travelled - to be built	
-   Builder
-   Job Number	
-   Sub Job Number	
-   Complete Date - will be broken into 2 periods (0,1) and (1,2,3,4)
-   Job Quantity	
-   Cost Type	
-   Segment One	
-   Segment Two	
-   Hours Regular	
-   Hours Overtime
-   Hours Other	
-   Committed - Total	P/O Received/Unapproved	
-   Equip/GL	
-   Quantity Budgeted - Cost	
-   Quantity Actual
-   Size of house - sqft/lots aka job quantity / geographic area 1
-   Unit of Measurement (UoM)
-   Success Fail (Binary variable on speed Range)


**Questions they hope to answer with the data**
 - How do a number of operational conditions affect labor productivity and how significant are are their relative impacts?
 - Given a number of known variables, how likely is a user-defined input for labor productivity to be successful 70% of the time?


## GitHub
### Main Branch README.md must include: 
- Description of the communication protocols 
- Individual Branches - https://github.com/nasch147/CVC-SQL1-EOSNAVIGATOR_DEV & https://github.com/ScottyMacCVC/CVC-SQL1-EOSNAVIGATOR_DEV
- At least one branch for each team member
- Each team member has at least four commits from the duration of the first segment 
Note: The descriptions and explanations required in all other project deliverables should also be in your README.md as part of your outline, unless otherwise noted.

## Machine Learning Model
### Team members present a provisional machine learning model that stands in for the final machine learning model and accomplishes the following:
- Takes in data in from the provisional database 
- Outputs label(s) for input data
- - SUPERVISED - CONTINUOUS MODEL (OLS REGRESSION)
- -UNSUPERVISED - LOGIT REGRESSION

## Database
### Team members present a provisional database that stands in for the final database and accomplishes the following: 
- Sample data that mimics the expected final database structure or schema (pgAdmin schema - https://github.com/ScottyMacCVC/CVC-SQL1-EOSNAVIGATOR_DEV/blob/main/DB_schema.sql)
![DB](https://github.com/ScottyMacCVC/CVC-SQL1-EOSNAVIGATOR_DEV/blob/main/Images/1-Database%20Tables.PNG)
- Draft machine learning module is connected to the provisional database {TBD)
