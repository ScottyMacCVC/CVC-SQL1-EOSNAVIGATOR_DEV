                    Our product is designed provide entry level construction database & reporting to small business concerns.
                     This unique combination of web-based services can afford construction subcontractors the ability to store and use their 
                     data to make actionable decisions. Many construction software solutions are targeted at larger General Contractors, Owners, 
                     and Builders, but there is an opportunity to provide low-tech-subcontractors a proper way to store and use data generated 
                     from thier activities. We would like to help move an entire industry into web-based data storage & analytics. There is a 
                     litany of talented construction workers who would like to start a company, but are held back by running the office and their 
                     field at the same time. The product would help bring the office to the field by moving the data from a silo'd excel document 
                     to a web-based source, making their information systems dynamic enough to deploy in a commercial application. Operations can 
                     interact with data in real time instead of waiting on manual reporting methods so commonly employed in the industry. There 
                     will be concern with upgrading to a new software and we need to answer, "How will it affect production?" Our built system 
                     would allow our customer to continue their current processes, but built to convert the information into more manageable and 
                     usable measurements. With Tableau, we can utilize the data, tell a story about the job's costs, and provide an in-depth view 
                     of construction by location.
                     <br><br>
                    We also seek to explore the effects of Covid on labor productivity. The cost of construction and ultimately the house itself, has risen during Covid. The question is, "has the labor productivity rates changed?" We know there is a dollar per hour rise, material dollar per unit have been driven up by supply chain issues, but we have no definitive proof of labor rate changes. Our team will analyze the data for labor productivity trends associated with the Covid time frame.
