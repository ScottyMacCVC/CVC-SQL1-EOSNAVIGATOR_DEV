REGRESSION OUTLINE

1. Read in file 

2. Test for heterskedasticity in the dependent variables relative to the independent variable.
	- use Breusch-Pagan
	- plot each dependent variable for distribution. 

3. Select regression functional form. 
	1. logit regression
		a. a binary dependent variable allows for the testing of whether or not a selected labor productivity rate is likely to be met. 

4. Adress Autoregression and suprious correlation.
	1. Save and plot residuals
	2. conduct dickey fuller test
		a - lag the right or left side to compensate based on results of statistical testing
5. Data treatment
	1. for machine learning purposes, the follwing categorical data will need to be altered for their application into supervised machine learning
		1. Job City - Data will be somewhat focused based on selection of geographic area. once filtered, remaining sample will need to be coverted to numeric values.
		2. Builder - will need to be converted to numeric value
		3. Completion date - to adjust for seasonal trends, each observation will be grouped into one of two groups indicating winter and not winter
		4. USE GET DUMMIES
		5. can be done in pandas. 
6. Regress different models and assess output information
 - MODEL 1
	- Dependent Variable = 'miss' (a binary varaible indicating whether or not a budgeted (selected) speed is within 30% of actual speed
	- Independent Variable = 'lots' - the number of lots in a subjob
	- Independent Variable =  'customer_name' - the builder of a project
	- Independent Variable =  'job_city' - the location of a project
	- Independent Variable =  'winter' - a binary variable indicating whether the project occurred during the winter months
	- Independent Variable =  'customer_name' - the builder of a project
	- Independent Variable =  'department number' - the business unit associated with the job. 
 - MODEL 2, 3, 4
 	- same as above but each dataset will only contain data from one 'department number'
- Split 80/20 into training and testing sets, respectively. 
7. Run 'Chow Test' to see if there is a satistically signifcant difference caused by COVID on labor prouctivity.
	- chowtest(y=df[['y']], X=df[['x']],
         last_index_in_model_1=15,
         first_index_in_model_2=16,
         significance_level=.05)
8. Generate Confusion Matrix and Summary Support
